        <p>
          As a Machine Learning Engineer and Research Scientist with over 7
          years of experience, I have led projects focused on building and
          deploying ML tools to solve complex problems. I specialize in applying
          ML to new, challenging, and difficult problems, with a strong emphasis
          on the practical application of ML.
        </p>
        <p>
          My technical skills include a solid grasp of Python as a core coding
          language, and expertise in a wide range of modeling techniques,
          including Neural Networks, LLMs, Ensemble Models, Bayesian
          Optimization, Clustering Algorithms, A/B testing, Latent Feature
          Modeling, and Deep Reinforcement Learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I am well-versed in Cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure,
          and GCP, as well as Big Data technologies such as Hive, Hadoop, and
          Kafka, and am proficient in ML Pipeline & Deployment tools like
          Airflow, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Dataswarm.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, as an ML generalist with experience in both modeling and
          MLOps, I possess a valuable toolkit of technical and non-technical
          skills that make me an asset to any team or project.
