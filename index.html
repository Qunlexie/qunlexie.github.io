        <h1>Hi, I'm Dr. Olukunle O.</h1>
        <p>
          I am a highly experienced Senior Machine Learning Engineer and
          Research Scientist with over 7 years of industry and research
          expertise in leading projects that apply Machine Learning tools to
          solve complex problems. With a passion for tackling difficult problems
          in new, challenging, or unfamiliar terrains, I possess a diverse skill
          set that spans across several domains.
        </p>

        <p>
          In terms of technical skills, I have a solid grasp of Python, SQL, and
          Spark. I am also proficient in applying a range of Machine Learning
          tools, including Neural Networks (LSTM, feed-forward), Collaborative
          Filtering, LLMs (Text), Ensemble Models, Bayesian Optimization,
          Clustering Algorithms, A/B testing, Latent Feature Modeling, and Deep
          Reinforcement Learning. I also have experience in non-technical skills
          such as Agile Methodology, Problem Formulation, XFN collaboration,
          Excellent Communication, Pattern Recognition, and People Management.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am also skilled in working with Cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure,
          and GCP, as well as Big Data technologies such as Hive, Hadoop, and
          Kafka. I have also worked with ML platforms like Sagemaker,
          Databricks, and Snowflake, and am proficient in ML Pipeline &
          Deployment tools like Airflow, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Dataswarm.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have a good understanding of a wide range of Machine Learning
          libraries and frameworks such as Sklearn, Pandas, Numpy, NLTK, OpenCV,
          StatsModels, SciPy, Pytorch, TensorFlow, Kats, and Prophet. In
          addition, I have expertise in Data Preprocessing tools such as NumPy,
          Pandas, and OpenCV, and am proficient in Data Visualization tools such
          as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tableau. I am also experienced in Time
          Series analysis using Kats and Prophet. Overall, I am a skilled and
          experienced Senior Machine Learning Engineer and Research Scientist
          with an impressive toolkit of technical and non-technical skills,
          making me a valuable asset to any team or project.
