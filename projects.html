          <h3>Deep learning Time Series Forecasting</h3>
          <p>
            Developed a time series regression model to predict future horizons.
            Both linear and non-linear models, including Prophet and Neural
            Prophet, were explored. Feature engineering and cross-validation
            were conducted, with the Hyperparameter-tuned Neural Prophet model
            achieving the best performance.

            Developed an Embedding model and a bag of word model (using Glove
            representation) for feature extraction for raw sentiment. Built
            Machine Learning models to be able to determine whether a review was
            good or bad from the sentence structure for each review. Compared
            and analysed performance of the models.

            occurrence of wildfire using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
            (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the Thermal Anomalies.
            Accounted for class biases by building models with and without
            weight balance. Performed comparative Analysis the performance of
            different Machine learning models (with careful hyperparameter
